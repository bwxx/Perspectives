High-level overview of changes to Perspectives

Format:
+ new feature
* bug or behavior fix
X Loss of functionality

We attempt to use meaningful version numbers, following semver.org:
	Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
	MAJOR version when you make large architectural changes,
	MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
	PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

* Add new whitelist icon (image file added, but code not hooked up yet)
* Minor improvements to the makefile formatting and output
X Localization tests temporarily removed so we can ship to patch the security bug. They still need to be transcribed/relocated to a non-javascript language to run at build time. (fixed in 4.4.1)
